[3] Imagine you have a closet full of shirts. What can you do to organize your shirts for easy retrieval?

We can try to sort it by some property (maybe color?), and then perform binary search since it is now sorted.
The sorting should take O(n log n) time complexity and the search would take O(log n). The overall time complexity is O(n log n).
