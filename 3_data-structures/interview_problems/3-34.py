[3] What method would you use to look up a word in a dictionary?

My answer:

A dictionary in the traditional sense consists of words sorted alphabetically.
Given a sorted list of these words as in a dictionary, I would conduct binary search to get the word I need.
This would be an O(log n) operation, where n is the number of words in the dictionary.
